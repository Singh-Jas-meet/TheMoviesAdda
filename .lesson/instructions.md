1. In this exercise, instead of using a hard-coded JSON, you will generating a JSON file dynamically by hitting an API. Documentation on how to access the API is provided here:
    - https://github.com/SpEcHiDe/IMDbOT/wiki

  Example: https://search.imdbot.workers.dev/?q=impossible will fetch a list of all Mission Impossible movies. 

2. Write an onclick event that calls a function that fetches movie details from the API and displays it within your HTML page. Use articles within sections like we did in code-along work.

3. You need not display all details from a movie. Just choose 3 or 4 promiment attributes of a movie including actors.

4. Change the styling if you deem fit.
5.
